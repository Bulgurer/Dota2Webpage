                <p class="text-white">Anti-Mage is a fast melee agility hero with an emphasis on disrupting and killing high-mana enemies. He has notably high agility and low base attack time, giving him high damage and scaling with his basic attacks. His signature ability is Mana Break, a passive attack modifier that makes him a huge threat to mana-reliant heroes, mainly Intelligence-based casters. Anti-Mage is typically played as a hard carry, mostly because of his ability to evade ganks and comfortably farm in the early game.</p>
